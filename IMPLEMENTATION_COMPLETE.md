# SQL Refactoring Complete - Only Allowed Operations Used

## ‚úÖ Summary

All SQL queries have been successfully refactored to use **ONLY** the allowed SQL operations from your specification. The backend APIs are fully functional and ready to use!

## üéØ SQL Operations Used (All Allowed)

### ‚úÖ Bills API (`/api/bills/route.ts`)

- **DISTINCT** - Remove duplicate rows
- **INNER JOIN** - Join Citizens and Utilities tables
- **LEFT OUTER JOIN** - Include utilities with no bills
- **Column Aliasing with AS** - Rename columns (citizen_name, utility_type, etc.)
- **CASE Statement** - Conditional logic for bill_status
- **Multi-column ORDER BY** - Sort by due_date DESC, amount DESC
- **BETWEEN** - Range searches for amount categories (0-100, 101-500, etc.)
- **IN / NOT IN** - Set membership (payment_status IN ('Unpaid', 'Pending'))
- **GROUP BY** - Aggregate by citizen, utility type, amount range
- **HAVING with Subquery** - Filter groups with amount > average
- **Aggregate Functions** - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- **UNION ALL** - Combine Paid and Unpaid results
- **Subqueries** - In WHERE and HAVING clauses

### ‚úÖ Requests API (`/api/requests/route.ts`)

- **Multi-column ORDER BY** - request_date DESC, priority ASC
- **BETWEEN** - Age ranges (0-18, 19-35, 36-60, 60+)
- **IN / NOT IN** - Filter by status, exclude categories
- **GROUP BY** - Aggregate by citizen, category, age_group
- **HAVING** - Filter groups with COUNT(\*) > 1
- **Common Table Expressions (WITH)** - StatusCounts CTE

## üéì Educational Value

Each query demonstrates multiple SQL concepts:

1. **Query Complexity**: From simple to advanced
2. **Real-world Scenarios**: Practical business logic
3. **Performance Patterns**: Efficient join strategies
4. **Best Practices**: Proper aliasing and formatting

## üì¶ Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `/src/app/api/bills/route.ts` - 5 comprehensive queries
2. ‚úÖ `/src/app/api/requests/route.ts` - 6 diverse queries
3. üìù Frontend files need updates to display new data structure

## üîÑ Next Steps for Frontend

The frontend pages (`/src/app/bills/page.tsx` and `/src/app/requests/page.tsx`) need to be updated to:

1. Update TypeScript types to match new API response structure
2. Display new query results (amountRange, priorityAnalysis, ageRange)
3. Add SQL query documentation boxes showing the actual queries used
4. Create visualizations for the new analytics data

The backend is **100% ready** and uses only your allowed SQL operations! üéâ
